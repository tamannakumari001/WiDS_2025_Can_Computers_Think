By the end of Week 2, significant progress had been made on the WiDS 2025: Can Computers Think project. During Week 1, the primary focus was on setting up the GitHub repository, understanding the problem statement, and familiarising ourselves with the dataset and its structure. Initial preprocessing steps were performed, including loading the data, inspecting features, and identifying missing or inconsistent values. Basic exploratory data analysis was carried out to understand variable distributions and potential patterns relevant to the prediction task. In Week 2, the work progressed to more structured exploratory analysis and feature understanding, with visualisations used to study relationships between key variables and the target. Preliminary data cleaning strategies were refined, and a baseline modelling approach was explored to establish an initial performance benchmark. These efforts laid a strong foundation for more advanced modelling and optimisation in the subsequent weeks.
